3.2. Technology of Site
3.3. Content of Site
3.1 Design of Site
The design of your web site will be developed by working with a professional our designers. It will involve unique creative elements for the web site, which will reflect and amplify the company's business image.

FITECHBOT  is the engine that will be used for the management of your web site .This technology is recommended by FITECH. The backbone languages in FITECHBOT include
PHP, HTML, MySQL, and JavaScript, along with a variety of other technologies, the programming is written for a quality visitor experience with a standard Internet browser, along with web page-based interactive tools for site administration.

3.3 Content of site
The site content would be based on material presented by the company or accumulated from existing resources. Additional content creation with the assistance of a professional writer andor photographer would require a separate proposal, available on request.
4    Examination of a sample web site structure
Well, just like any other website, components of the website will have to be implemented for the proper overflow of the website as a whole. Below is a generic layout of elements that will be contained in the web site. This sample's structure would be subject to change as the process of site creation takes place. The actual web site completed per this proposal may be significantly different than the example shown here.
Although the Requirement Analysis phase will determine the nature and character of the web site development project, we have taken the liberty of suggesting sub-headings and topics for the purposes of this proposal.
These topics would be featured in a Navigation Toolbar, found on every web page.
4.1 Home Page 
Every site begins with a primary introduction page. This page should give focus to the Overall site, and offer links to all major areas and functions. Links back to the Home Page will be accessible on every page in the web site. Appropriate design choices for the Home Page will be an important part of the development process. The Home Page will anchor the site and pull its elements together, rather than simply be a promotional introduction.
4.2 Products
Promotional material for the company's products would be shown, with appropriate links and options. Links to an Internet Store could be featured here. (See Additional Functions and Features for an Internet Store option.)
4.3 Support
Technical information, FAQ's, and manuals for products are shown here. A support form could be included to report problems and request assistance.
4.4 Calendar
The Calendar would list all current company events, and would keep expired events visible for a set number of days. A special web page interface, protected with a password, would be available to add, delete, or modify entries to this Calendar. Calendar events could include a link to an Event Page describing the activity. A sample Event Page template and Event Registration form would be included.
4.5 Gallery
This section could display pages of images. (The Gallery could also be used for documents, sound files, Acrobat PDF files, or other library functions.) A pre-built template would display pictures as thumbnail images on section pages. Hundreds of images could be supported.
4.6 Current Events
This page would list current events that the company is involved in. For example, this may list current media coverage. A web page interface would be used to add or delete items from this page. Links could be added to each item.
4.7 Our Company
This section would list contact information for the company and staff. Maps and driving directions would be included. Company history, biographies, pictures, and links to other pages andor sites could also be added.
4.8 Links
Links to other web sites can be an important service for visitors. A web page interface would be used to add or remove links from this page. Links would be organized by a topic heading.
In addition to the Home Page and Navigation Toolbar sections, three other pages would be included:
4.9 Contact Form
This web page will accept information from a site visitor, and send it as an Email message to a desired address. The Contact Form is a standard tool for managing messages from the web site back to the organization. A single contact form will support a different email address for each topic area. A web page interface will make management of email addresses for the contact form possible from any web browser.
4.10 Site Map
The Site Map is a page that contains text-based links to each primary area of the site. It is a convenient way to navigate around areas of a web site, and to see a complete overview of the topics that it presents.
4.11 Search Results
A Search field and button will be available on each web page. When pressed, the entire website will be searched for a matching text string, and the results will be displayed on this page as content with a link. Along with searching the entire site, search ranges could be limited to a specific topic or site area. This would be additional to this proposal.
4.12 Administrator Section Panel (Important)
The website will have an administration panel for adding articles managing images, and managing the whole site as a whole. This makes it easier for the site to be edited and managed from any web browser software.
The administrator panel has login security check that only allows vulnerable people having login passwords to gain access. All login credentials shall be given to the Client after the full payment has been made.";
